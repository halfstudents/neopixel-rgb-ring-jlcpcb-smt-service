# neopixel-rgb-ring-jlcpcb-smt-service
Hello guys, today we are going to make this RGB ring using Neo pixel led's. we will learn, something new about Neo pixel, how to operate them, how to show different animations and how to make your own RGB neo pixel ring. In last we will control them using Arduino Nano board and make some cool stuff to show by combining all the rings.

Components required:
1) Arduino Nano

2) Custom PCB's

3) Wires and all

4) Soldering equipments

Troubleshooting:
1) Din is always connected to Dout in series with on e another, if connected in opposite or disconnected from anywhere whole setup stops working.

2) Make sure all the connections are properly soldered, dry soldering will cause change in data value and color.

3) Don't heat the PCB too much, while Soldering and keep the temperature on 300*c.

JLCPCB:
I have my own Arduino boards because of JLCPCB to program them/troubleshoot them and learn from them. If you want to make your own board, the JLCPCB SMT service can be the solution.
